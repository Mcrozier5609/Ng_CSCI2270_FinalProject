# Ng_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Project summary-
  I implemented a connect 4 game using 2-D arrays. For the game, there is no set up, so all each player will need to input is the column in which they place their piece. There are multiple functions to check if there is a connect four, and functions for when the players place pieces. The pieces are subject to gravity, which is why only the column needs to be inputted. There is also be a visual image for the board.

How to Run-
  There are no external files to read in, the only files needed are "FinaLProject.cpp", "Board.h", and "Board.cpp". To use the program after you run it, all you need to do is follow the menus. The program will display the connect four board every turn, 1's representing player 1's pieces, and 2's representing player 2's pieces. The zeroes represent empty spaces.

Dependencies-
N/A

System Requirements-

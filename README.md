# Ng_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Project summary-
  I will be implementing a connect 4 game using 2-D arrays. For the game, there is no set up, so all each player will need to input is the column in which they place their piece. There will be multiple functions to check if there is a connect four, and functions for when the players place pieces. The pieces will have to be subject to gravity, which is why only the column needs to be inputted. There will also be a visual image for the board.
